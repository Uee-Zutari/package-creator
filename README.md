# Package Creator

## Description
An editor tool that helps you setup the initial layout of your new editor, runtime or standard project.
The tools allows you to create Package json file as well as the required Readme, Changelog and 
ThirdPartyLicense md files.

You can test your package by exporting it temporarily to the package folder to view and update
additional package.json settings that is required by the unity package manager.

NB! 
All packages require one or more Assembly Definitions to separate your logic into blocks, such as Runtime and Editor.
